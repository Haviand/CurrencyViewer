------- 
This code is based on Krakenex Python3 API by veox: https://github.com/veox/python3-krakenex 

* v0.2.0

This is a tiny program I personally use it daily. 
It allows me to check my currencies without logging every 10 minutes on Kraken website. 
This is also very useful for developers on the Krakenex API thanks to dynamically extracted data. 

Please note that you need to fill your kraken.key file with your API keys. You can easily generate a pair of keys on the Kraken website, see the API documentation : https://www.kraken.com/help/api  

v0.2.0 Changes 
---------------- 
Adding CSV log writing feature. 
Providing more object-oriented code and more library-oriented.

TODO :
It is also planned to add other exchanges than Kraken. 

Your data logs are now stored by default in data.csv and is located in the same directory. 

I wish you a good ‘back-to-school’ !

Program features 
---------------- 

1.    Displaying the different amount of crypto currencies you own on your Kraken wallet. 

2.    Displaying the total crypto money you own in equivalent fiat money. 

3.    Adapted to the crypto and fiat currencies you already own. 

4.    If you don't own any fiat money on your Kraken wallet, it will be displayed the equivalent in USD. 
	   
5.    Working with multi-fiat currencies wallets.

6. Writes data in a csv file located in the project folder (default : data.csv).

NOTE: Some bugs need to be fixed with fiat currencies other than EUR or USD,
it will be patched in the next one.
