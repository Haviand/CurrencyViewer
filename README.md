v0.1

This is a tiny program I personally use it daily.
It allows me to check my currencies without logging every 10 minutes on Kraken website.
This is also very useful for developpers on the Krakenex API because of dynamically extracted data.

This program features:

1.    Displaying the different amount of crypto currencies you own on your Kraken wallet.

2.    Displaying the total crypto money you own in equivalent fiat money.

3.    Adapted to the crypto and fiat currencies you already own.

4.    If you don't own any fiat money on your Kraken wallet, it will be displayed the equivalent in USD.
	  (The fiat money can be easily modified but be aware that some markets doesn't allow it,
      DASHUSD -> DASHJPY for example, can't be done because the market doesn't exist on Kraken.
      Check k.query_public('Ticker',{'pair': 'YOURMARKET',}) inline to know if it exist.)
	  
5.    Working with multi-fiat currencies wallets.


Interesting variables:

data : Raw data received from Kraken API of user's current wallet

data_price : Raw real-time data received from Kraken API of market pair (crypto/fiat))

currencies : List of differents currencies owned by user

balance : List of the differents amount of crypto currencies owned by client

market :  List of markets concerned by currencies in user's wallet (same order as price)

price : List of prices of crypto currencies in markets concerned by user (same order as market)

totals : List of total differents fiat money owned by user

values : Dictionnary of current values in fiat money user's crypto currencies balance is equivalent to (according to real-time markets)
		Keys are dynamically generated by markets concerned by user
		
total : Dictionnary of total differents fiat money owned by user



	
TODO:
1. Manage exceptions with crypto/fiat currencies pair markets that doesn't exist on Kraken
2. Add e-mail sender with timer or interruptions to user (user will add its own e-mail to ensure privacy)
